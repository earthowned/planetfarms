              Over the last ten years, the emphasis on reducing fuel emissions has been an agenda for many governments. In a
              carbon footprint, many people have started looking for a way to control their
              impact on the environment. It is due to such a situation that the use of Ethanol fuel has increased in many
              countries. However, those wanting to switch to a different type of fuel have many questions about Ethanol.
              Many of these are concerned with what this fuel really is and how big a dent it makes in our lives and
              pockets.

              Ethanol, which is sometimes known as ethyl alcohol, is a kind of alcohol derived from corn, sugarcane, and
              grain or indirectly from paper waste. It’s also the main type of alcohol in most alcoholic beverages obtained
              (gin, vodka, and whiskey) or sugarcane (rums). It’s also a
              source of fuel commonly blended with gasoline to oxygenate the fuel at the gas pump. Ethanol fuel can also be
              used on its own to power vehicles.
